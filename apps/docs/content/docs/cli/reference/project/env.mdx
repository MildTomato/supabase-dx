<DemoVideo id="supa-project-env" />

The `supa project env` commands let you store, sync, and manage environment
variables for your Supabase project without using the dashboard. Variables
are scoped to environments (development, preview, production, or custom)
and can have branch-level overrides.

## Features

The env subsystem covers the full lifecycle of environment variables:

- **Pull and push workflow**: Sync variables between your local `.env`
  file and remote environments
- **Secret management**: Mark variables as write-only secrets that are
  never exposed in reads
- **Branch overrides**: Set per-branch variable values for preview
  environments
- **Environment seeding**: Copy variables from one environment to another
- **Custom environments**: Create additional environments beyond the
  three defaults

## Quick start

Get started with the most common operations:

```bash
# List variables in development
supa project env list

# Set a variable
supa project env set API_KEY "sk_test_123"

# Set a secret (write-only, never returned in reads)
supa project env set STRIPE_KEY "sk_live_456" --secret

# Pull remote variables to local .env
supa project env pull

# Push local .env to remote
supa project env push

# List all environments
supa project env list-environments
```

## How it works

Environment variables are stored remotely per-environment. The local
`supabase/.env` file acts as the working copy for pull and push
operations.

- **`env pull`** fetches non-secret variables into `supabase/.env`
- **`env push`** computes a diff and uploads `supabase/.env` to the
  remote environment
- **`env set`** and **`env unset`** modify individual variables directly
  on the remote
- Secret variables are write-only and can never be read back

Sensitive fields in `supabase/config.json` use `env()` references
(for example, `"secret": "env(SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_SECRET)"`)
that resolve at push time. See
[auth-provider](/docs/cli/reference/project/auth-provider) for details
on how secrets are stored.

### Branch overrides

For preview environments, you can set branch-specific variable values:

```bash
supa project env set DEBUG "true" --branch feature-x
```

Branch overrides take precedence over the base environment value when
that branch is active.

## Local files

These files live in your `supabase/` directory:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.env` | Working copy for pull and push (add to `.gitignore`) |
| `.env.local` | Local-only overrides, never pushed to remote |

## Next steps

- Set a variable: `supa project env set API_KEY "value"`
- Pull variables from remote:
  `supa project env pull --environment production`
- View all options: `supa project env --help`

## Usage

```bash
supa project env
```

### `pull`

Pull remote environment variables to .env file


<DemoVideo id="supa-project-env-pull" />

Fetches environment variables from the remote environment and writes
them to your local `supabase/.env` file. Secret variables are excluded
because they're write-only and can't be read back.

If `supabase/.env` already exists, you're prompted before overwriting
unless you pass `--yes`.

```bash
supa project env pull [options]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `-e, --environment <NAME>` | string | Environment name (default: development) |
| `-y, --yes` | boolean | Skip confirmation prompts |
| `--json` | boolean | Output as JSON |
| `-p, --profile <NAME>` | string | Profile to use |

**Examples:**

Run this after cloning a project to bootstrap your local environment:

```bash
git clone <repo> && cd <repo>
supa project env pull
```

The resulting `supabase/.env` file looks like:

```
API_KEY=sk_test_123
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
```

Add `supabase/.env` to `.gitignore` to avoid committing secrets.

```bash
supa project env pull
```

Useful for debugging production issues locally. Combine with
`--json` to pipe into other tools:

```bash
supa project env pull --environment production --json | jq '.variables'
```

```bash
supa project env pull --environment production
```

---

### `push`

Push local .env variables to remote environment


<DemoVideo id="supa-project-env-push" />

Reads your local `supabase/.env` file, computes a diff against the
remote environment, and applies the changes. You see a summary of
additions, updates, and deletions before confirming.

By default, variables that exist remotely but aren't in your local
file are left untouched. Pass `--prune` to remove them.

```bash
supa project env push [options]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `-e, --environment <NAME>` | string | Environment name (default: development) |
| `--prune` | boolean | Remove remote variables not present locally |
| `--dry-run` | boolean | Show what would be done without applying |
| `-y, --yes` | boolean | Skip confirmation prompts |
| `--json` | boolean | Output as JSON |
| `-p, --profile <NAME>` | string | Profile to use |

**Examples:**

You see a diff before anything is applied:

```
+ NEW_VAR = "hello"
~ API_KEY = "sk_test_old" → "sk_test_new"

Apply 1 addition and 1 update? (y/n)
```

Pass `--yes` to skip the prompt in CI.

```bash
supa project env push
```

Use dry run in a CI check step to catch unintended changes before
deploying:

```bash
# CI pipeline
supa project env push --dry-run --environment production --json
# exits 0 with a diff summary, no changes applied
```

```bash
supa project env push --dry-run
```

Without `--prune`, variables that exist remotely but not in your
local file are left untouched. With `--prune`, they're deleted so the
remote matches your local file exactly. Combine with `--dry-run`
first to review what would be removed:

```bash
supa project env push --prune --dry-run
```

```bash
supa project env push --prune
```

---

### `set`

Set a single environment variable


<DemoVideo id="supa-project-env-set" />

Sets a single environment variable on the remote environment. If the
variable already exists, its value is updated. Pass `--secret` to
mark it as write-only so it's never returned in list or pull
operations.

If you omit the value argument, the command reads from stdin, which
is useful for piping in multi-line values or reading from files.

```bash
supa project env set <KEY> [VALUE] [options]
```

**Arguments:**

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `KEY` | Yes | Variable name |
| `VALUE` | No | Variable value (reads from stdin if omitted) |

**Options:**

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `-e, --environment <NAME>` | string | Environment name (default: development) |
| `-b, --branch <NAME>` | string | Branch name for environment variable override |
| `--secret` | boolean | Mark variable as write-only secret |
| `--json` | boolean | Output as JSON |
| `-p, --profile <NAME>` | string | Profile to use |

**Examples:**

You can also pipe values from stdin, which is useful for multi-line
values or reading from files:

```bash
cat cert.pem | supa project env set TLS_CERT
```

```bash
supa project env set API_KEY "sk_test_123"
```

Once set, secret values are never returned by `list` or `pull`. Use
this for API keys, OAuth secrets, and other credentials. Reference
them in `supabase/config.json` with `env()` syntax:

```json
{
  "secret": "env(STRIPE_KEY)"
}
```

```bash
supa project env set STRIPE_KEY "sk_live_456" --secret
```

Branch overrides let you test different config per feature branch
without affecting the base environment. When the branch is merged
or deleted, clean up the override with `unset --branch`:

```bash
supa project env unset DEBUG --branch feature-x
```

```bash
supa project env set DEBUG "true" --branch feature-x
```

---

### `unset`

Delete an environment variable


<DemoVideo id="supa-project-env-unset" />

Deletes a single environment variable from the remote environment. If
the variable has branch overrides, you can target a specific branch
with `--branch` instead of removing the base value.

```bash
supa project env unset <KEY> [options]
```

**Arguments:**

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `KEY` | Yes | Variable name to delete |

**Options:**

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `-e, --environment <NAME>` | string | Environment name (default: development) |
| `-b, --branch <NAME>` | string | Branch name for environment variable override |
| `-y, --yes` | boolean | Skip confirmation prompts |
| `--json` | boolean | Output as JSON |
| `-p, --profile <NAME>` | string | Profile to use |

**Examples:**

This removes the variable from the environment entirely, including
any branch overrides. You're prompted before deletion unless you pass
`--yes`.

```bash
supa project env unset OLD_KEY
```

Removes only the override for `feature-x`. The base value in the
environment is unchanged, and other branch overrides aren't affected.

```bash
supa project env unset DEBUG --branch feature-x
```

---

### `list`

List environment variables for an environment


<DemoVideo id="supa-project-env-list" />

Displays all environment variables for the given environment. Secret
variables appear with a placeholder value. Pass `--json` to get
machine-readable output.

```bash
supa project env list [options]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `-e, --environment <NAME>` | string | Environment name (default: development) |
| `-b, --branch <NAME>` | string | Branch name for environment variable override |
| `--json` | boolean | Output as JSON |
| `-p, --profile <NAME>` | string | Profile to use |

**Examples:**

Output shows variable names and values in a table. Secrets display
as `••••••••` since they're write-only. Pass `--json` to get
structured output for scripting:

```bash
supa project env list --json | jq -r '.[].key'
```

```bash
supa project env list
```

Combine with `--branch` to see branch-level overrides alongside
base values:

```bash
supa project env list --environment preview --branch feature-x
```

```bash
supa project env list --environment production
```

---

### `list-environments`

List all environments for the project


<DemoVideo id="supa-project-env-list-environments" />

Shows all environments configured for the project, including the three
defaults (development, preview, production) and any custom
environments you've created.

```bash
supa project env list-environments [options]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `--json` | boolean | Output as JSON |
| `-p, --profile <NAME>` | string | Profile to use |

**Examples:**

Shows the three default environments plus any custom ones. Pass
`--json` to get machine-readable output for scripting:

```bash
supa project env list-environments --json | jq -r '.[].name'
```

```bash
supa project env list-environments
```

---

### `create`

Create a custom environment


<DemoVideo id="supa-project-env-create" />

Creates a custom environment beyond the three defaults. You can
optionally copy all variables from an existing environment with
`--from`, or use `--interactive` to select which variables to copy.

```bash
supa project env create <NAME> [options]
```

**Arguments:**

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `NAME` | Yes | Environment name to create |

**Options:**

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `--from <ENV>` | string | Copy variables from this environment |
| `-i, --interactive` | boolean | Interactively configure the environment |
| `--json` | boolean | Output as JSON |
| `-p, --profile <NAME>` | string | Profile to use |

**Examples:**

Starts with a clean slate. Add variables afterward with `set` or
`push`:

```bash
supa project env create staging
supa project env set DATABASE_URL "postgresql://..." --environment staging
```

```bash
supa project env create staging
```

Copies all non-secret variables from production. Secret variables
(like API keys) are write-only and must be set separately on the new
environment:

```bash
supa project env create staging --from production
supa project env set STRIPE_KEY "sk_staging_..." --environment staging --secret
```

```bash
supa project env create staging --from production
```

---

### `delete`

Delete a custom environment


<DemoVideo id="supa-project-env-delete" />

Permanently deletes a custom environment and all its variables. The
three default environments (development, preview, production) can't be
deleted. You're prompted for confirmation unless you pass `--yes`.

```bash
supa project env delete <NAME> [options]
```

**Arguments:**

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `NAME` | Yes | Environment name to delete |

**Options:**

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `-y, --yes` | boolean | Skip confirmation prompts |
| `--json` | boolean | Output as JSON |
| `-p, --profile <NAME>` | string | Profile to use |

**Examples:**

This permanently removes the environment and all its variables. The
three defaults (development, preview, production) can't be deleted.
Pass `--yes` to skip the confirmation prompt in CI:

```bash
supa project env delete staging --yes
```

```bash
supa project env delete staging
```

---

### `seed`

Seed one environment from another


<DemoVideo id="supa-project-env-seed" />

Copies environment variables from one environment to another. This is
useful for bootstrapping a new environment or resetting an environment
to match production. Secret variables aren't copied because they're
write-only.

```bash
supa project env seed <TARGET> [options]
```

**Arguments:**

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `TARGET` | Yes | Target environment to seed |

**Options:**

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `--from <ENV>` | string | Source environment (required) |
| `-i, --interactive` | boolean | Interactively select variables to copy |
| `-y, --yes` | boolean | Skip confirmation prompts |
| `--json` | boolean | Output as JSON |
| `-p, --profile <NAME>` | string | Profile to use |

**Examples:**

Overwrites existing values in staging with production values. Secret
variables aren't copied. Preview the diff first with `--dry-run`:

```bash
supa project env seed staging --from production --dry-run
```

```bash
supa project env seed staging --from production
```

Opens a multi-select picker showing all variables from the source
environment. Useful when you only need a subset of production config
in staging.

```bash
supa project env seed staging --from production --interactive
```

## Examples

### Push local .env to production

Always preview with `--dry-run` before pushing to production:

```bash
supa project env push --environment production --dry-run
supa project env push --environment production
```

```bash
supa project env push --environment production
```

### Set a secret variable

Reference secrets in `supabase/config.json` with `env()` syntax.
The value is resolved at push time and never stored in version
control:

```json
{
  "secret": "env(STRIPE_KEY)"
}
```

```bash
supa project env set STRIPE_KEY "sk_live_456" --secret
```

### Seed staging from production

A common pattern when setting up a new staging environment:

```bash
supa project env create staging
supa project env seed staging --from production
supa project env set STRIPE_KEY "sk_staging_..." --environment staging --secret
```

```bash
supa project env seed staging --from production
```
