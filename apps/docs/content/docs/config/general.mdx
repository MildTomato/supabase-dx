description: Project identity and workflow configuration
---

General settings control your project's identity and how the CLI manages schema
and configuration changes.

## Project identity

The `project_id` identifies your Supabase project. It's set automatically when
you run `supa init` and link to a project.

```json
{
  "project_id": "my-app-production"
}
```

This ID appears in your project URL (`my-app-production.supabase.co`) and is
used to distinguish between multiple projects on the same machine.

## Workflow profile

The `workflow_profile` determines how commands like `supa dev` and
`supa project push` behave.

```json
{
  "workflow_profile": "solo"
}
```

| Profile | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `solo` | Direct development against production. Best for solo developers or early prototypes. |
| `staged` | Changes flow through a staging environment before production. |
| `preview` | Manual preview environments for testing changes in isolation. |
| `preview-git` | Git-driven preview environments that auto-create per branch. |

For details on each workflow, see [Workflow Profiles](/docs/cli/workflow-profiles).

## Schema management

The `schema_management` setting controls how database schema changes are
tracked and applied.

```json
{
  "schema_management": "declarative"
}
```

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `declarative` | Describe the desired state in SQL files. The CLI calculates and applies the diff. |
| `migrations` | Traditional versioned migration files. You write the up/down migrations manually. |

Declarative mode is recommended for most projects. It reduces boilerplate and
prevents migration drift.

## Config source

The `config_source` setting determines where your project configuration lives.

```json
{
  "config_source": "code"
}
```

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `code` | Your local `config.json` is the source of truth. Push changes with `supa project push`. |
| `remote` | The Supabase dashboard is the source of truth. Pull changes with `supa project pull`. |

Use `code` when you want configuration in version control. Use `remote` when
multiple team members manage settings through the dashboard.

## Example configuration

A typical general configuration for a team project:

```json title="supabase/config.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://supabase.com/schema/config.json",
  "project_id": "acme-app",
  "workflow_profile": "staged",
  "schema_management": "declarative",
  "config_source": "code"
}
```
