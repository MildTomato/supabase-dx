<DemoVideo id="supa-bootstrap" />

Bootstrap a new project from a starter template. This command downloads a
template from the Supabase community samples repository, creates a new
Supabase project, waits for it to be ready, pushes any included migrations,
and writes a `.env` file with your project credentials.

## Interactive flow

When run without arguments, `supa bootstrap` walks you through an interactive
flow:

1. **Template selection** -- pick from community starter templates or start
   from scratch
2. **Authentication** -- logs you in if needed
3. **Project creation** -- choose an org, name your project, pick a region
4. **Wait for ready** -- polls until the database and connection pooler are
   healthy
5. **Push migrations** -- applies any `.sql` files found in
   `supabase/migrations/`
6. **Write `.env`** -- generates a `.env` file with your API keys and
   database connection strings, merging with `.env.example` if present

## Created files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `supabase/config.json` | Project configuration linked to your cloud project |
| `supabase/migrations/` | Database migration files (from the template) |
| `.env` | Environment variables with API keys and database URLs |

## Usage

```bash
supa bootstrap [template] [options]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `template` | No | Template name (optional, interactive if omitted) |

## Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `-y, --yes` | boolean | Skip prompts and use defaults |
| `--json` | boolean | Output as JSON |
| `--dry-run` | boolean | Show what would be done without applying |
| `-w, --workdir <DIR>` | string | Directory to bootstrap into (default: current directory) |
| `-p, --password <PASSWORD>` | string | Password for remote Postgres database |

### `--workdir`

Specify a directory to bootstrap into. If the directory does not exist, it
will be created. If it already exists and is non-empty, you will be prompted
to confirm overwriting.

Defaults to the current working directory.

### `--password`

Provide a password for the remote Postgres database. If not specified, the
password generated during project creation is used automatically.

This password is included in the `POSTGRES_URL` and related connection
strings written to `.env`.

## Examples

### Interactive setup

Launches the full interactive flow: template picker, authentication,
project creation wizard, and environment setup. This is the recommended
way to start a new project.

```bash
supa bootstrap
```

### Use a specific template

Skip the interactive template picker by passing a template name directly.
Run `supa bootstrap --json` without a template name to list all available
templates.

```bash
supa bootstrap nextjs
```
