description: Declarative authorization for Supabase

Auth Rules lets you define who can access what in your Supabase app using simple SQL. Write rules once, and your API automatically enforces them.

## The problem

Row Level Security can be frustrating:

- **Silent failures** — Queries return empty results instead of telling you why
- **Hidden logic** — Authorization rules scattered across policies
- **Row-only** — No way to control which columns are exposed
- **Hard to audit** — Difficult to see what access rules exist

## The solution

With Auth Rules, you define access in two parts: **claims** (what users have access to) and **rules** (what they can do with it).

Here's a complete example. Say you have users, organizations, and documents. Users should only see documents in orgs they belong to.

First, define the claim — the relationship between users and orgs:

```sql title="claims.sql"
SELECT auth_rules.claim('org_ids', $$
  SELECT user_id, org_id FROM org_members
$$);
```

Then, define the rules — what users can do with documents:

```sql title="rules.sql"
-- Users can read documents in their orgs
SELECT auth_rules.rule('documents',
  auth_rules.select('id', 'org_id', 'title', 'content'),
  auth_rules.eq('org_id', auth_rules.one_of('org_ids'))
);

-- Users can create documents in their orgs
SELECT auth_rules.rule('documents',
  auth_rules.insert(),
  auth_rules.eq('org_id', auth_rules.one_of('org_ids'))
);

-- Users can only delete their own documents
SELECT auth_rules.rule('documents',
  auth_rules.delete(),
  auth_rules.eq('created_by', auth_rules.user_id())
);
```

That's it. Your client code stays the same:

```typescript title="app.ts"
// Only returns documents from user's orgs
const { data } = await supabase.from('documents').select('*')

// Fails with clear error if user isn't in that org
await supabase.from('documents').insert({ org_id: 'other-org', title: 'Test' })
```

## What you get

Auth Rules gives you:

- **Column control** — Specify exactly which fields to expose
- **Clear errors** — Write operations fail with meaningful messages
- **Auditable rules** — See all access rules with `SELECT * FROM auth_rules.list_rules()`
- **No client changes** — Your existing Supabase queries work as-is
