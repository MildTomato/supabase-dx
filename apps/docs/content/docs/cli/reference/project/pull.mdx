<DemoVideo id="supa-project-pull" />

Pull schema and configuration from your remote project to local.

Fetches the current state of your hosted project and updates your local `supabase/` directory. Use this to get changes made by teammates or to bootstrap from an existing project.

## Usage

```bash
supa project pull [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `-p, --profile <NAME>` | string | Profile to use |
| `--plan` | boolean | Show what would happen without making changes |
| `--types-only` | boolean | Only generate TypeScript types |
| `--schemas <SCHEMAS>` | string | Schemas to include for type generation (default: public) |
| `--json` | boolean | Output as JSON |
| `-v, --verbose` | boolean | Show detailed pg-delta logging |
| `-y, --yes` | boolean | Skip confirmation prompt |

### `--types-only`

Skip schema sync and only regenerate TypeScript types from the current remote schema. Fast way to update types after making changes in the dashboard.

## Examples

### Pull remote state

```bash
supa project pull
```

### Preview what would be pulled

```bash
supa project pull --plan
```

### Only regenerate types

```bash
supa project pull --types-only
```
