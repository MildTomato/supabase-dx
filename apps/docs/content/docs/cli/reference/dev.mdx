<DemoVideo id="supa-dev" />

Watch for local changes and sync them to your Supabase project in real-time.

Monitors your `supabase/` directory and automatically pushes changes as you save. Keep this running while you develop for a live sync experience.

## Usage

```bash
supa dev [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `-p, --profile <NAME>` | string | Profile to use |
| `--debounce <MS>` | string | Debounce interval for file changes (e.g., 500ms, 1s) |
| `--types-interval <INTERVAL>` | string | Interval for regenerating types (e.g., 30s, 1m) |
| `--no-branch-watch` | boolean | Disable git branch watching |
| `--seed` | boolean | Run seed files after schema sync (also re-seeds on schema changes) |
| `--no-seed` | boolean | Disable seeding even if enabled in config |
| `--dry-run` | boolean | Show what would be synced without applying |
| `-v, --verbose` | boolean | Show detailed pg-delta logging |
| `--json` | boolean | Output as JSON (events as newline-delimited JSON) |

### `--seed`

Re-runs seed files automatically whenever schema changes are applied. Keeps your dev database populated with test data as you iterate.

### `--dry-run`

Shows what would be synced without applying changes. Useful for debugging sync issues or understanding what the watcher detects.

## Examples

### Start development watcher

```bash
supa dev
```

### Watch with specific profile

```bash
supa dev --profile staging
```

### Preview changes without applying

```bash
supa dev --dry-run
```

### Watch with automatic seeding

```bash
supa dev --seed
```
